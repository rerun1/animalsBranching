          <p>The endearing behavior of playful otters can put a smile on most people's faces. You may have seen some of their well-known antics such as sliding, bouncing pebbles on their paws as though juggling, and wrestling. People have even observed otter games of tag. But all this fooling around isn't a waste of time. Like play for human children, otters' playfulness is inadvertently significant.</p>
          <p><a href="https://youtu.be/iDsITyAJzTo">Michelle Wolff</a> has a few warnings and commentary about Otters. The palate cleanser is a gag about otter-on-seal rape, her example of how “we can turn anything into a controversy these days”. To those who get too exercised about such matters, she says – as Aziz Ansari did in his recent show – “You’re too woke. Go back to sleep a little.” But that argument doesn’t get developed, as she sidesteps towards battle-of-the-sexes comedy. A riff on childbirth and periods asserts (and revels in) how “gross” women are, despite pretences to the contrary. An “if men had periods” hypothesis reaps big laughs, as Wolf imagines women grateful everywhere for their suddenly more emotional menfolk.</p>

            <p>An earthworm is a tube-shaped, segmented worm found in the phylum Annelida. They have a world-wide distribution and are commonly found living in soil, feeding on live and dead organic matter. An earthworm's digestive system runs through the length of its body. It conducts respiration through its skin. It has a double transport system composed of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed blood circulatory system. It has a central and a peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food toward the worm's anus.</p>
